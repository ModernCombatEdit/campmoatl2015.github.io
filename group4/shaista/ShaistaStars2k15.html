  <h1> FlyBot </h1>
  <h3> Bio </h3>
  <h4>  A scientist named Shaz was trying to invent something for his boss. But all of a sudden, he went outside to stare at the
    birds when he saw some birds and said, "WHAT ARE THOOOOOSE!!!!". He said that he wishes he could fly and thought of inventing
    a jetpack. After countless hours of work and Starbuckz (the frappacinoz :) He finally built a successful jetpack. He tested
    it on his servant robot but never saw the robot again. There have been reported sightings and the public has given the robot
    name FlyBot. The reward for finding FlyBot is $2,000,000 and one year of free Starbuckz! Do you have what it takes to find
    this robot? </h4>
