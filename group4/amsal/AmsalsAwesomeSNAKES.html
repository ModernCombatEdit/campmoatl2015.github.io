  <h1> The Prowl <h1>

    <h3> The prowl is a deadly monsterous robot trying to vandalize the human
      race. He was created accidentaly by a scientist. At first the scientist
      was excited that he had created artificial intelligence, but his mind
      changed a few seconds before the monster deleted him. The Prowl only comes
       out at night, but during the day he seems like a happy-go-lucky, straight A,
       over acheiving student. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> The Prowl has fangs that are made to chew meat effectively. </li>
    <li> The Prowl has poison in his fangs. </li>
    <li> Just one bite from his fangs means a slow and painful boo boo. </li>
    <li> His eyes are entrancing and it is extremely hard to look away. </li>
    <li> Inside his shirt he carries an array of spray paint cans to help him vandalize the human race. </li>
    <li> He can reach speeds of up to 125 miles per hour </li>
