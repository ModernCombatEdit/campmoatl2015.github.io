<h1> The Story of Bob </h1>
<h4> By: Z. and L. </h4>
<p class="image"><img src="bob.jpg" /></p>
<p>
On a dark and rainy day, a bob was born.  Bob had gone through a very complicated and troubled life.
His mom had died during childbirth, and his planet was in enormous turmoil. Serenity had run out of water,
and an alien tribe was coming to take over.  Bob was worried he had no place to go, and his family had
  abandoned him.  He needed to get off the planet Serenity.  It was being destroyed, and with no water he could not survive for very long.  The clock was ticking and time was against him.
  He hitchhiked into one of the alien ships. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A guard was coming.  Bob was holding very still. 20 hours, in Bob was very thirsty.
  He stealthily knocked out everyone on the ship, and zoomed to Earth.  He wanted to create a new identity for himself, and using his shapeshifting powers he became a human.
  BOB THE HUMAN!
