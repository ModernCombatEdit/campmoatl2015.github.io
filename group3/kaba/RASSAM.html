<p><h3><center>There is a FBI agent,named Hannah,  who's
   parents disappeared near the SAPD (San Antonio Police Department).
    An former FBI agent tells her that El Guapo  actually has them captured.
  He sends her to the Texas Ranger to find El Guapo.
  Hannah ignored what the old man said and went to her ofice at the FBI.
  She sat down at her brown desk and looked around. She saw no one because she
  was early. She was curious so she decided to walk around the office and decided
  to get coffee.Inside one of the drawers she saw a big, brown, briefcase
  labeled, "PRIVATE". She was curious,so she took a look inside the briefcase
  and found incriminating evidence showing that her parents were still alive. She
  decided to go to the Texas Ranger and find El Guapo. She found the Texas Ranger
  and she helped Hannah find El Guapo.When they found El Guapo, she realised that
  it was a trap! El Guapo and the Texas Ranger had captured Hanah. It turns out
  that they were married. Hannah usd her FBI training to release her and her
  parents from El Guapo's fortress. And they lived happily ever after...
  ...FOR NOW!
