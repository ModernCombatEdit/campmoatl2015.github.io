<p>
  She was a normal girl who was from New Dehli, India.  It all started when she didn't get to
  play sports with the kids at school.  After that year, a sense of hatred grew throughout her body.
  Nowadays, she is the average CRIMINAL until she took a wild chance.

  <h1> Altharash </h1>
   <p> A heroic crime fighter who saves the city of Kryptish on a day to day basis. </p>

<p>
  He was the average naughty boy from Islamabad, Pakistan.  He would always do mean things and insult people.
  But it all changed the day he saved a civilian from a moving train.  After that day, he dedicated his life to keep
  the city safe, and he became ALTHARASH!!...and everything was perfect until Bobbi Dil showed up.
