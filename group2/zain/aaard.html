   <h1> A Bullying Story </h1>
  <p> Once there was a middle schooler named Maya who got bullied, because she was different. She was very intelligent but was also
    a target of bullies. Maya made no friends, because she was called "THE NERD!!" For example, in every class she was the "teacher's pet"
    and "the assistant". She never cared what other people said, until there was a day that changed her life! When a girl named Skylar came into
    her life, she flipped. Maya started questioning her appearance and how her life was, because Skylar was the beauty queen of the school.
    She was known as the "nerd torturer." One day Skylar went to Maya and told her really hurtfull things that were not school appropriate.
    Maya did not do anything about it, but soon enough it went way to far. She started to push her around and abused her for every little move she took.
    She finally told her parents about the bully Skylar. Her parents helped her figure her way out of it.
         MORAL: If your ever being bullied tell your parents all about it and it will become better.
