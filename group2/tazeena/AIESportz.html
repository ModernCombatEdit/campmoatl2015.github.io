   <p> Splash! The basketball goes in the net without touching the backboard or the rim.
      Basketball is a very intresting sport. It all started when a doctor made a game for the students
    so they wouldnt get bored during the snow or rain. Many of us probably know about the NBA. It is the
  most poppular league for the sport of bashetball. Personally, my favorite team in the NBA
is probbably The Golden State Warriors, they won the finals this year. There is a international
league called FIBA. This year the USA team won the championships. Thanks for reading! </p>

   <h2>Soccer</h2>
   <p>  Have you ever played soccer. If you have not you've missed out on abig thing.
   Soccer is pretty simple if you think about it.
 Soccer has a ball of course and it also has 2 goals. if you give someone a minor injory in soccer
usually a yellow card is pulled out. If something is big and you trip someone and
cause a big injury you get a red card.
The skills you need to play soccer are teamwork and cooperation.
If you want to do anything when you grow up just work towards your dream.
Dont forget you wont face alot of difficulties but if you do dont stop.
Dont be offende by rude comments and ignore.
Last but not least remember your big and small family.
